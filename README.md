# Static Node.js and Express Site

This project has been built for two main reasons, on one hand to showcase my previous work using different web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. On the other hand to get more practice using npm, Node js, Express and git.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Node JS and npm installed
http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/

```
Node JS
npm
Express
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running for this project

steps will be:

- make sure you have npm and Node js installed, you can learn how to do that here: http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/

- Download the project files, [here is the link if you need it](https://github.com/luisgiraldov/static-node-js-and-express-site)

- Open your terminal/console and make sure to be inside the project folder.
for example
```
cd downloads/project_folder
```

- Then type in your terminal/console
```
npm install 
```
That will install all project's dependencies

- Start your server by typing:

```
npm start
```
or 
```
node app.js
```

- Go to your browser and type http://localhost:3000/
